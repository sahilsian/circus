Welcome to Golux

Golux is a big one, and is currently in development. The end goal with Golux is to let users create complex form systems, completely from no code.

There are several components to Golux, key ones being:

Golux CMS: A place where users can create applications for data collection, completely in no code. Users can have AI autofill their demands or manually make edits, or both. 

*Say you own a car dealership, and you need a platform that lets your employees track inventory, track customers, link customers with vehicles... a lot of stuff*

*Just create your system and deploy it with Golux! Have complete control of who accesses your system and you dont need to pay a development team any dime! everything is built from the ground up, you wire your own system.*

Golux Head: A Golux head is a working client that renders completely from the server. Golux heads are convenient for horizontal scalling, and are completely decoupled from the CMS.

Golux is heavily inspired by legacy systems. Golux uses a dotnet server for its CMS and each head. Golux also uses SignalR as a main communication method from server to heads. Golux uses a collection of React components, with heavy inspiration from Sencha ExtJS.
